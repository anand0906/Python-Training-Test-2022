<h1>Introduction To Programming</h1>
<h3>Progamming Langauge</h3>
<h6>Language</h6>
<p>Language is a set of words,sounds or written symbols which can be used to share the feelings and thoughts with others.</p>
<p>Eg : Telugu,Engligh,Hindi..etc</p>
<h6>Program</h6>
<p>A Program can be defined as set of instructions that can be executed by the computer to perform specific task.</p>
<h6>Programming Language</h6>
<p>A Programming Language is a set of rules that can be used to command or communicate with the computer</p>
<p>Eg : c,c++,java,python..etc</p>
<h3>How Programming works ??</h3>
<p>Basically computer can understand only two things.</p>
<ol>
	<li>OFF(Represented With '1')</li>
	<li>ON(Represented With '0')</li>
</ol>
<p>Computer consists of billions of transisters.Each transister either in ON state or OFF state based on power given to it.</p>
<p>These transisters work together to perform various tasks.</p>
<p>So if we need to command the computer we have to give instructions in the form of 1 or 0 called as binary langauge</p>
<p>For example, this is how you would write “Hello World” in binary:</p>
<p>01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100</p>
<p>When we pass this text to computer.computer will activate respective transister.so then it will give the required output</p>
<p>So, Any electronical device can understand only binary language, Also called as Machine languge</p>
<p>But Humans can't understand this binary language.Also Machines can't understand the human language</p>
<p>So we use programming language that can be understand by both human and computer.</p>
<p>Computer uses a device that converts the programming language into the binary language called as transalater</p>
<p>Eg : Compiler,Intrepreter,Assembler.</p>
